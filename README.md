**UR3move MATLAB Function with RMRC**


*Overview*

The UR3move function in MATLAB is designed to simulate the movements of a UR3 robotic arm using the Resolved Motion Rate Control (RMRC) method. This script demonstrates basic manipulations like picking and placing, leveraging forward and inverse kinematics integrated with RMRC for smoother and more precise control.


*Features*

RMRC Integration: Utilizes Resolved Motion Rate Control for improved movement accuracy.

Robot Model Initialization: Employs the UR3 robotic arm model.

Pre-defined Poses: Sequence of poses for the robot, showcasing a variety of movements.

Workspace Configuration: Allows setting custom workspace dimensions.


*Usage*

Function Execution: Run UR3move() in MATLAB, ensuring the UR3 robot model is included in your workspace.

Visualization: Watch as the script animates the robot through various poses, using RMRC for motion control.


*Requirements*

MATLAB with Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox installed.


*Function Details*


Workspace and Poses: Sets the workspace size and initializes a series of poses for the robot.

RMRC Algorithm: Employs RMRC for calculating joint velocities, ensuring smooth and accurate movements.

Kinematics and Motion: Combines forward and inverse kinematics with RMRC for real-time motion simulation.


*Example Output*


The function demonstrates the UR3 robot executing a series of movements, such as lifting, picking, and placing, within a defined workspace, all controlled with RMRC for enhanced precision.


*Additional Notes*


This script is especially useful for those learning about robotic arm movements and RMRC.
Make sure the UR3 model and necessary MATLAB libraries are correctly installed in your MATLAB environment.
